# veng plans

Plans are grouped into numbered **plansets**, each a coherent phase of work.

- **[planset-1](planset-1/README.md)** — API rework / insulation (✅ complete,
  2026-06). Ownership, error handling, deferred destruction, vocabulary enums,
  public/backend split, render graph, ImGui module, headless context, typed
  buffers. (Plan 12, runtime shader reflection, was intentionally *not* built —
  superseded by planset-2, see below.)

- **[planset-2](planset-2/README.md)** — shader-driven pipeline API & surface
  cleanup (🚧 in progress). Move shader reflection to import time, derive
  pipeline/descriptor/push-constant/vertex layouts from the shader interface,
  and trim the rendering API surface.
